# Algorithm-for-efficient-image-deduplication
Deep Learning based algorithm to efficiently find duplicate images in datasets and made it available through a Python package for easy use.
This problem is especially relevant in situations where we need to store large amounts of data (Machine Learning datasets, images on our phones etc.),
in order to save storage space and reduce Machine Learning modelsâ€™ biases. The algorithm is up to 515 times faster than the naive alternative.
